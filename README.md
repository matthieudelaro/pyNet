# pyNet
My own implementation of a neural network in Python for MNIST dataset.
It requires Python 3.5 (@ operator for dot product), and idx2numpy package.
To train the network, run ./src/LoopyNet.py

##File Architecture:
### ./data/
Training and testing data sets reside in ./data. Those are
ignored in the repot, but can be downloaded automatically
by running ./downloadAssets.sh.

### ./src/
